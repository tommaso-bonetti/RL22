# RL22

This VHDL module was developed as one of the final examination projects required to obtain the BSc in Computer Science and Engineering at [Politecnico di Milano](https://www.polimi.it/).

The project obtained a grade of 30/30. It is related to and based on concepts taught in the Digital Logic Design course, taught by prof. William Fornaciari.

## Description

The module to describe is a convolutional encoder with 1/2 transmission rate, as specified in the project requirements. A project report in Italian, detailing the
specifications and explaining the module architecture, design choices and testing strategy, can be found in this repository.

## Tools and languages

The project was developed using Xilinx Vivado. The module is described in VHDL and was synthesized for an Artix-7 target FPGA.
